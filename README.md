## 1. About Me
Hello! I am a postgraduate student currently reading for the **Master of Cyber Security** .

My academic focus is on Network Security and Ethical Hacking. I am currently building a strong theoretical foundation through my coursework while gaining practical experience in controlled lab environments. This portfolio serves to document my learning curve, academic projects, and my journey toward becoming a cybersecurity professional.

## 2. Technical Skills
As part of my Master's curriculum, I am developing proficiency in the following areas:

* **Network Defense:** Understanding secure network architectures and protocols (WQE7007).
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Learning to identify system flaws using standard industry tools (WQE7011).
* **Secure Programming:** Writing scripts for network interaction and analysis (WQE7002).
* **Tools:** Familiarity with Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Linux environments (Kali/Ubuntu).
* **Research:** Academic research on cyber threat trends and security standards (WOX7001).
## 3. Certifications and Training
**Degree in Progress:**
* **Master of Cyber Security** - University of Malaya (Current)

**Key Coursework Completed/In-Progress:**
* **WQE7001 Cyber Security:** Focusing on security governance and professional portfolio building.
* **WQE7011 Advanced Computer Penetration and Defence:** Studying attack methodologies and defense strategies.
* **WQE7007 Network Technology and Security:** Analyzing network infrastructure security.
* **WQE7002 Advanced Network Security Programming:** Developing coding skills for security applications.

## 4. Project Experience
*Below are selected academic projects and labs completed during my coursework.*

### Project 1: System Vulnerability Assessment (Academic Lab)
* **Context:** Conducted as part of the WQE7011 Advanced Computer Penetration and Defence module.
* **Objective:** To identify vulnerabilities in a target virtual machine (Metasploitable) within a closed lab network.
* **Tools Used:** Nmap, Metasploit Framework.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  Performed network discovery to identify active hosts.
    2.  Ran port scans to detect open ports and service versions.
    3.  Analyzed results to find known vulnerabilities in legacy services.
    4.  Simulated an exploit execution to understand the impact of unpatched systems.
* **Outcome:** Successfully documented the "attack chain" and proposed theoretical mitigation strategies such as disabling unused ports and applying security patches.

### Project 2: Network Traffic Analysis (Coursework Assignment)
* **Context:** Completed for WQE7007/WQE7002 Network Security modules.
* **Objective:** To capture and analyze network packets to understand how data is transmitted insecurely.
* **Tools Used:** Wireshark, TCPdump.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  Captured traffic during a simulated file transfer session (FTP/HTTP).
    2.  Used packet filtering to isolate TCP streams.
    3.  Inspected packet payloads to identify clear-text credentials.
* **Outcome:** Gained a practical understanding of why encryption (TLS/SSL) is critical by observing how easily clear-text data can be intercepted.
